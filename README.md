Buffs In Shop
</h1>

<h3 align="center">Adds many tower buffs to the in game shop that can be directly purchased for towers</h3>

Adds 20+ of the game's buffs as entries into the shop that can be purchased to permanently apply them to a tower.

Most buffs get a 50% discount for subsequent purchases.

By default, buffs will only show up in the shop if the tower/upgrade they originate from is allowed to be used in the
current match. This can be configured in the Mod Settings, along with the costs of the buffs.
(To make a buff stop appearing in the shop at all, set the cost to -1)

There is also a setting that allows placing buffs on any tower regardless of the Tower Set or Tower Type restrictions.
